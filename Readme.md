1) We have attached screenshots of 3 different screens of our UI. While these don't represent
all the graphical elements that we have, they ought to represent most.


2) Also, some classes do have code in them. They represent the code
for the UI creation and nothing else.


3) Most of our classes are self explanatory. That's why no comments have been
added to them.


4) All the java classes can be found in the .src folder.


5) If you want to compile with maven that's also possible but please
remember to add the javafx lib path to the module path while running
if you want to run the pom.xml.
